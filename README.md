# Audio Signal Processing

:warning: **This repository is a work in progress.** :warning:

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to experiment and learn various audio DSP concepts. Since it is a work in progress, I will be adding more plots as I go along. The idea is to gather fundamental knowledge about audio DSP in one place, and to provide a visual reference for the concepts discussed.

## Folder Structure

```bash
.
├── audio       # Audio files
├── plots       # Notebooks focusing on plots
└── signal      # Notebooks focusing on signal processing concepts
```
